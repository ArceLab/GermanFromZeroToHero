Hey wonderful human being, this is an app I made a while back but decided to make it public so feel free to make any kind of changes with it.
BTW you can download the app directly from the PlayStore here:

Having troubles trying to learn "Deutsch" (German)?
I had those too... That's why I made an app that will help you with.
You don't need previous knowledge about German or learning languages. What you need is a couple of minutes, lost the fear to talk in front of other in German, and just have fun!
- "Live Learning", an AI (Artificial Intelligence) that help you identify the world around you by reading out loud what you see through your camera 🤖📸 Pretty Dope Eh? 😏
- Global Chat (So you can practice with other users) 🤓
- Grammar section 📚
- Integrated Translator (So you don't have to leave the app 😉
- Examples for each section 🤠
- And last but not least, Puppies! 🥳🐶

Next updates:
- Stories...
- More Quizzes
- And more 😏
